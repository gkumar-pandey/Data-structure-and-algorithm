# Linked List

- A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers. each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

### Array vs Linked List

| Linked List                                | Array                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Non Contgous                               | Contiguous                   |
| Allocate one by one to individual elements | Allocated to the whole array |
| Access : Sequential                        | Access: Random               |

1. **Data** : It holds the actual value or data
2. **Next** : it stores the address of the next node.
3. **Node** : Each element is called as Node

### Types of Linked List

1. Single-linked list
2. Double-linked list
3. Circular linked list

### Single-Linked List

- each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Traversing a singly linked list is done in a forward direction.
